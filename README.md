This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe pointer manipulation.  The `bug.rs` file showcases code that modifies a vector using a raw pointer, which can lead to undefined behavior if not carefully managed.  The `bugSolution.rs` provides a safe alternative, emphasizing Rust's ownership and borrowing system. The example highlights the importance of adhering to Rust's memory safety rules to avoid data corruption and program crashes.  Always prefer safe Rust over unsafe where possible.
